# Derive algorithm efficiency from its structure

Sometimes, it's possible to identify an algoriths efficiency class based on
the pseudocodes structure.

For example, assigments such as \\(v \leftarrow E \\) are usually assumed to
take constant time, \\(O(1) \\).

Saying that, there will still be times where we may need to produce summations
or recurrence relations in order to determine the efficency class accurately.

## Independent loops

Loops that iterate a fixed number of times have their loop body executed in
direct proportion to the loops variable range.

```
for j <- 0 to n - 1 do  \ O(n) 
    x <- x + 1          /
```

Nested loops are analysed from the innermost to the outermost

```
for i <- 0 to n - 1 do             \
    for j <- 0 to n - 1 do  \ O(n)  | O(n^2)
        x <- x + 1          /      /
```

## Dependent loops
Dependent loops occur when a loop variable depends on another. In these cases
we need to produce a summation to accurately identify the efficiency class.

```
for i <- 0 to n - 1 do                 \
    for j <- i to n - 1 do  \ O(n-i)    | O(n^2) 
        x <- x + 1          /          /
```

\\[
    \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}((n-1)-i+1) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-i) = n + (n-1) + \dots + 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n \in O(n^2)
\\]

## Iteration with uneven steps
Loops where the size of steps increase/decrease by a power have a logarithmic
or exponential growth.

```
i <- 1

while i < n do                            \
    for j <- 0 to n - 1 do  \ O(n) \       \ O(n log n)
        x <- x + 1          /      | O(n)  /
    i <- i * 2     // O(1)         /      /
```

\\[
    \sum_{x=1}^k n = n \cdot k = n \cdot \log_2 n \in O(n \log n)
\\]

## Balanced loops
In certain situations, two nested loops can counter-balance themselves leading
to a 'obvious' result in an non-obvious way.

```
i <- 1

while i < n do                         \
    for j <- 1 to i do  \ O(i) \        \ O(n)
        x <- x + 1      /       | O(i)  /
    i <- i * 2    // O(1)      /       /
```

\\[
    \sum_{x=0}^{k-1} 2^x = 2^{(k-1)+1} - 1 = 2^k - 1 = n - 1 \in O(n)
\\]

## Sequential composition
For sequential statements, \\(S_1, S_2, ..., S_k \\), the total efficiency
is the sum of the individual statements efficiencies. However, the overall
order of growth is determined by the largest polynomial term for any individual
statement.

For example,

```
for i <- 0 to n - 1 do  \ O(n)        \
    x <- x + 1          /              \
                                        \ O(n^2)
for i <- 0 to n - 1 do      \           /
    for j <- 0 to n - 1 do   | O(n^2)  /
        x <- x + 1          /         /
```

## Conditionals
The worst-case order of growth for a conditional is the largest, most expensive, 
path that could be taken.

```
if B             \
    S_1 // O(m)   \ O(max(m, n))
else              /
    S_2 // O(n)  /
```
