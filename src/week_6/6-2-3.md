# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a stable divide-and-conquer algorithm. This means it works by recursively 
breaking breaking down the problem into two smaller sub-problems until one of these
becomes simple enough to be solved. The solution of all sub-problems then combine
to provide the solution to the original problem.

Merge sort consists of two main processes:
1. Recursively breakdown an (sub)array into two smaller sub-arrays
2. Combine two sorted sub-arrays to form one sorted (sub)array

```
ALGORITHM Merge(A[i..j], m)
// Merges two sorted sub-arrays A[i..m] and A[m+1..j] into a single sorted sub-array
// A[i..j], via a temporary array T[i..j]

p <- i
q <- m + 1
r <- i

while p <= m and q <= j do
    if A[p] <= A[q] then
        T[r] <- A[p]
        p <- p + 1
    else
        T[r] <- A[q]
        q <- q + 1

    r <- r + 1

if p <= m then
    T[r..j] <- A[p..m]

if q <= j then
    T[r..j] <- A[q..j]

A[i..j] <- T[i..j]
```

```
ALGORITHM MergeSort(A[i..j])
// Sorts sub-array A into non-decreasing order from position i to position j inclusively

if i < j then
    m <- floor((i + j) / 2)
    MergeSort(A[i..m])
    MergeSort(A[m + 1..j])
    Merge(A[i..j], m)
```

## Efficiency
In a worst case scenario, merge sort will take

\\[
    c_{worst}(n) \in O(n \log n)
\\]

where \\(n\\) represents the length of the array
