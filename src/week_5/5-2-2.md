# Introduction

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a non-linear data structure in which each node has at most two 
children.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A((A)) --> B((B))
    A((A)) --> C((C))
    B((B)) --> D((D))
    B((B)) --> E((E))
    C((C)) --> F((F))
    F((F)) --> G((G))
    G((G)) --> H((H))
```

In mathematical terms we could describe a binary tree as a set of \\(T\\) nodes
such that either:
- \\(T\\) is empty
- \\(T\\) is partitioned into three disjoint subsets
    - A single node root
    - Two possible empty sets called left and right subtrees of the root
