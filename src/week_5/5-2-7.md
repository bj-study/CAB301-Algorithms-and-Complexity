# Binary Search Tree: Delete

## Deleting
When deleting a node from a binary tree, three cases need to be considered:
1. The node to be deleted is a leaf
2. The node to be deleted has only one child
3. The node to be deleted has two children

### The node is a leaf
If the node to be deleted is a leaf, all we need to do is simply update its parents
pointer to null.

### The node has one child
If the node to be deleted has only one child, all we need to do is update its parents
pointer to point to the child.

### The node has two children
If the node to be deleted has two children, we must transform the problem as such
to match one of the previous two cases.
1. Find the right-most node in the left sub-tree pointer
2. Copy the item of the right-most node to the pointer
3. Delete the right-most node

## Algorithm
```
ALGORITHM Delete(K, root)
ptr <- root
parent <- null

while ptr != null and ptr.item != K do
    parent <- ptr
    
    if ptr.item < K
        ptr <- ptr.lchild
    else
        ptr <- ptr.rchild

if ptr != null
    if ptr.lchild != null and ptr.rchild != null
        if ptr.lchild.rchild = null
            ptr.item <- ptr.lchild.item
            ptr.lchild <- ptr.lchild.lchild
        else
            p <- ptr.lchild
            pp <- ptr

            while p.rchild != null do
                pp <- p
                p <- p.rchild

            ptr.item <- p.item
            pp.rchild <- p.lchild
    else
        if ptr.lchild != null
            c <- ptr.lchild
        else
            c <- ptr.rchild

        if ptr = root
            root <- c
        else
            if ptr = parent.lchild
                parent.lchild <- c
            else
                parent.rchild <- c
```
