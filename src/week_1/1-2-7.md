# Why do we need to worry about the efficiency of an algorithm?

If computers are fast and memory cheap, why is there a need to worry about
efficiency?

Consider an algorithm which can solve some problem of size \\(n \\) by processing
\\( 2^n \\) cases, \\(T(n) = 2^2 \\). We now want to implement this on some computer
which takes 0.000000005 seconds per case.

| Problem size | Solution time |
|--------------|---------------|
| 10 | 5.1 micro-seconds |
| 20 | 5.2 milli-seconds |
| 30 | 5.4 seconds |
| 40 | 1.5 hours |
| 50 | 9.3 weeks |
| 60 | 183 years |
| 70 | 1872 centuries |
| 80 | 192 million years |
