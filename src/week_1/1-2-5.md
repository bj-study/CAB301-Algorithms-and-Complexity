# Algorithm efficiency and algorithm analysis

## Algorithm efficency
Algorithm efficiency is generally represented as a mathematical function which
describes the resource requirements of the algorithm. These requirements describe
the amount of data each algorithm must process before it finishes.

There are two main measures used to describe an algorithms efficiency:
1. **Time efficiency**: A mathematical function which describes the amount of time
an algorithm will take to finish in relation to its input.
2. **Space efficiency**: A mathematical function which describes the amount of
space, or storage, an algorithm must take to finish in relation to its input.

## Algorithm analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of determining how efficient an algorithm is.

Algorithm analysis is done independent of a language or machine. This is because
the efficiency of an algorithm will change depending on the language implementation
and processing power of the machine.
