# What are data Structures?

In computer science, there are many ways to store and organise collections of
data, we call these collections data structures.

There are many data structures such as:
- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Binary trees
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash tables
- etc...

No single data structure will work for all purposes, hence the need for many.
This is why it's important that you can recognise the strenghs, weaknesses, 
limitations, and use cases for each data strcture.

Throughout the course, we will delve into different algorithms that will require
the use of many different data structures. Overtime you will start to recognise 
and learn when to use each one.
