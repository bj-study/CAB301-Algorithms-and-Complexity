# Algorithm analysis - An example

Let's take a look at an algorithm we've seen previously.

```
ALGORITHM ArrayMax(A[0..n - 1])
// Given an array A of length n >= 1, 
// return the value of the largest number in A
max <- A[0]              // c1
for i <- 1 to n - 1 do
    if A[i] > max        // c2
        max <- A[i]      // c3
return max               // c4
```

In a worst case scenario, the computational time for this algorithm can be
appoximated using the following mathematical function.

\\[
    T(n) = c1 + (c2+c3)(n-1)+c4
\\]

where \\(c1, ..., c4 \\) are machine dependent, they will always have
the same computation time.

Let's imagine we run this on some machine and time how long it takes to compute
each expression.
- c1 = 3 micro-seconds
- c2 = 2 micro-seconds
- c3 = 3 micro-seconds
- c4 = 1 micro-seconds

\\[
    T(n) = 3 + (2+3)(n-1)+1 = 5n - 1
\\]

We could then say:
- When \\(n = 10\\), \\(T(10) = 5*10-1 = 49 \\) micro-seconds
- When \\(n = 100\\), \\(T(100) = 5*100-1 = 499 \\) micro-seconds
- When \\(n = 1000000\\), \\(T(1000000) = 5*1000000-1 = 4999999 \\) micro-seconds
