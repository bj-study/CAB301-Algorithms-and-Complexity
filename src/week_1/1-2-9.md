# The Tower of Hanoi - Code example

Here is an implementation of the algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi 
problem in C#

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Program {
    public enum Rod {
        Source,
        Intermediate,
        Destination
    }

    public static void Main() {
        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();

        Console.Write("Number of disks: ");
        int diskCount = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        sw.Start();
        TowerOfHanoi(diskCount, Rod.Source, Rod.Intermediate, Rod.Destination);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine($"Computation time = {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} milli-seconds");
    }

    public static void TowerOfHanoi(int n, Rod source, Rod intermediate, Rod destination) {
        if (n > 0) {
            TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, destination, intermediate);
            Console.WriteLine($"Move the top disk from {source} to {destination}");
            TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, intermediate, source, destination);
        }
    }
}
```

All code examples shown in the study guide will be in C# as this is the language 
taught in the unit. However, occasionally, you will see examples of Rust code 
along with C# code. 

The engine that runs and formats these study guides only has support for runnable 
Rust code. Therefore, if I want to have runnable code, it needs to be in Rust.

Anytime there is Rust code, you can safely ignore it and just hit the run button
to see the output as it will emulate (for the most part) what the C# code would output.

Be aware however, that it is very easy to timeout the program if the algorithm 
takes too long to run due to the constraints of the books engine.

```rust,editable
use std::fmt;

enum Rod {
    Source,
    Intermediate,
    Destination
}

impl fmt::Display for Rod {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            Self::Source => write!(f, "Source"),
            Self::Intermediate => write!(f, "Intermediate"),
            Self::Destination => write!(f, "Destination"),
        }
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Change this value here
    let disk_count = 3;

    TowerOfHanoi(disk_count, &Rod::Source, &Rod::Intermediate, &Rod::Destination);
}

fn TowerOfHanoi(n: usize, source: &Rod, intermediate: &Rod, destination: &Rod) {
    if n > 0 {
        TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, destination, intermediate);
        println!("Move the top disk from {} to {}", source.to_string(), destination.to_string());
        TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, intermediate, source, destination);
    }
}
```
