# What is an algorithm?

## What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a sequence of instructions which can be followed to solve some
computational problem. Due to algorithms being independent of a programming language,
they can typically be implemented into any.

## Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a way of writing the steps of an algorithm out in plain text without 
getting stuck by a specific programming language syntax.

Sometimes within pseudocode, we informally describe 'obvious' actions. For example,
within the SelectionSort algorithm, we might just use the term 'swap' to describe
the action.
