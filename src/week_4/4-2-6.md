# Bubble Sort

The basic idea behind a bubble sort is to systematically exchange pairs of data
items in the list that are out of order until eventually no such pairs remain in
the list. Once all pairs in the list are in order, the list is sorted.

## Algorithm
```
ALGORITHM BubbleSort(A[0..n-1])
// Sorts a given array by bubble sort
// Input: An array A[0..n-1] of orderable elements
// Output: Array A[0..n-1] sorted in non-decreasing order

for i <- 0 to n - 2 do
    for j <- 0 to n - 2 - i do
        if A[j+1] < A[j] swap A[j] and A[j+1]
```

## Efficiency

\\[
    C(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}\sum_{j=0}^{n-2-i}1 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}[(n-2-i)-0+1] \\\\
    = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2}(n-1-i) = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \in O(n^2)
\\]
