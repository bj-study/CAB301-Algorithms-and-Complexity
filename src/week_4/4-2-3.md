# Stable sorting algorithms

## Sorting Algorithm Applications
Let's imagine that we have some collection of `Person` objects.

```rust
struct Person<'a> {
    first_name: &'a str,
    family_name: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> Person<'a> {
    fn new(first_name: &'a str, family_name: &'a str) -> Self {
        Self {
            first_name,
            family_name
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let array = [
        Person::new("John", "Doe"), 
        Person::new("Jane", "Smith"), 
        Person::new("Jacob", "Brown")
    ];
}
```

Our goal is to sort the array in alphabetical order however, because the `Person` 
class lacks a comparison method we can't do this out-of-the-box. 

We can achieve this using a stable sorting algorithm. First, we sort each `Person`
in the array by their first name, then we by their last name.
