# Depth-first Search

## Depth-first Search
Given a vertex \\(v\\), the depth-first search traversal proceeds along
a path from \\(v\\) branching left at each vertex until it can no longer 
traverse deeper, i.e. the last vertex. Once it can no longer proceed, it 
backtracks and proceeds again.

```
ALGORITHM DFS(G)
// Implements a depth-first search traversal of a given graph
// Input:
//     Graph G = <V, E>
// Output
//     Graph G with its vertices marked with consecutive integers
//     in the order they were first encountered

mark each vertex in V with 0 as a mark of being "unvisited"
count <- 0
for each vertex v in V do
    if v is marked with 0
        dfs(v)
```
```
PROCEDURE dfs(v)
count <- count + 1
mark v with count

for each vertex w in V adjacent to v do
    if w is marked with 0 then
        dfs(w)
```
