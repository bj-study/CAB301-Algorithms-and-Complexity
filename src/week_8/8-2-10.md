# Prims's Algorithm

## Prims's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm begins with any vertex. Initially, the minimum spanning tree
contains only the starting vertex.

At each stage, the algorithm selects a least-cost edge from among those that
begin with a vertex in the tree and end with a vertex not in the tree. The latter
vertex and least-cost edge are then added to the tree.

This process is repeated until all the vertices are added to the tree

```
ALGORITHM Prim(G)
// Prims's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree
// Input:
//     A weighted connected graph G = <V, E>
// Output:
//     E_{T}, the set of edges composing a minimum spanning tree of G

V_{T} <- {v_{0}}
E_{T} <- an empty set

for i <- 1 to |V| - 1 do
    find the minimum weighted edge e* = (v*, u*) among all the edges in (v, u)
    such that v is in V_{T} and u is in V - V_{T}

    V_{T} <- V_{T} union {u*}
    E_{T} <- E_{T} union {e*}

return E_{T}
```
