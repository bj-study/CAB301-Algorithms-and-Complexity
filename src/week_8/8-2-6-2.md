# Breadth-first Search

## Breadth-first Search
Given a vertex \\(v\\), after visiting it, visit all the unvisited vertices
that are adjacent to \\(v\\). Then, visit all the unvisited vertices that are
two edges apart from \\(v\\), and so on until all vertices have been visited.

```
ALGORITHM BFS(G)
// Implements a breadth-first search traversal of a given graph
// Input:
//     Graph G = <V, E>
// Output
//     Graph G with its vertices marked with consecutive integers
//     in the order they were visited

mark each vertex in V with 0 as a mark of being "unvisited"
count <- 0
for each vertex v in V do
    if v is marked with 0
        bfs(v)
```
```
PROCEDURE bfs(v)
count <- count + 1
mark v with count
initialise a queue with v

while the queue is not empty do
    for each vertex w in V adjacent to the front vertex do
        if w is marked with 0 then
            count <- count + 1
            mark w with count
            add w to the queue

    remove the front vertex from the queue
```
