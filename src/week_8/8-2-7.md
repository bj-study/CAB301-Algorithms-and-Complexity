# Topological Sort

## Topological Sort
A topological sort algorithm is used DAGs, directed acyclic graphs.

A DAG has a natural order, i.e. you must visit node A before node B.

Topological sorting is to find the order of vertices in a DAG such that each
vertex comes before all vertices which it has an edge to.

```
ALGORITHM TopologicalSort(G)
// Input:
//     DAG G = <V, E>
// Output
//     A sequence of all the vertices of G such that each vertex
//     comes before all vertices to which it has an edge

G'(V', E') <- G(V, E)

while V' != an empty set do
    find a vertex v thats in V' such that in-degree(v) = 0
    output v
    remove v and all the edges adjacent to v

```
