# Kruskal's Algorithm

## Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm works by first sorting the edges of the graph in ascending
order and then tries to add edges one by one to an initially empty tree. If, 
when the item is added, a cycle is not formed, then the edge is included otherwise
not. This process is repeated until \\(n - 1\\) edges have been added to the tree,
where \\(n\\) is the number of the vertices in the graph.

```
ALGORITHM Kruskal(G)
// Kruskal's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree
// Input:
//     A weighted connected graph G = <V, E>
// Output:
//     E_{T}, the set of edges composing a minimum spanning tree of G

sort E in non-decreasing order of the edge weights w(e_{i_{1}}) <= ... <= w(e_{i_{|E|}})
E_{T} <- empty set
e_counter <- 0
k <- 0

while e_counter < |V| - 1 do
    k <- k + 1
    if E_{T} union {e_{i_{k}}} is acyclic
        E_{T} <- E_{T} union {e_{i_{k}}}
        e_counter <- e_counter + 1

return E_{T}
```
