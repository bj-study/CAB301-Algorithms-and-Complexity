# Adjacency Matrix

## Adjacency Matrix

### Unweighted Undirected Graph
An adjacency matrix for an unweighted undirected graph of \\(N\\) vertices is 
an \\(N \cdot N \\) array \\(A\\) such that \\(A[i][j]\\) is 1 if there is an edge
between vertex \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and 0 otherwise.

For example, some graph \\(G\\):
- \\(V = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\)
- \\(E = \\{(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (C, D), (D, E)\\}\\)

would be represented as an adjacency matrix like so:

```
  A B C D E
A 0 1 1 1 1
B 1 0 1 0 0
C 1 1 0 1 0
D 1 0 1 0 1
E 1 0 0 1 0
```

### Weighted Undirected Graph
An adjacency matrix for an weighted undirected graph of \\(N\\) vertices is 
an \\(N \cdot N \\) array \\(A\\) such that \\(A[i][j]\\) is the weight of the edge
between vertex \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and \\(\infty\\) otherwise.

### Unweighted Directed Graph
An adjacency matrix for an unweighted directed graph of \\(N\\) vertices is 
an \\(N \cdot N \\) array \\(A\\) such that \\(A[i][j]\\) is 1 if there is a
directed edge between vertex \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and \\(\infty\\) otherwise.

### Weighted Directed Graph

directed edge between vertex \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), and \\(\infty\\) otherwise.
