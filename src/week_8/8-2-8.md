# Spanning Tree & Minimum Spanning Tree

## Spanning Tree
A spanning tree of a connected undirected graph \\(G\\) is a connected subgraph
of \\(G\\) such that all of \\(G\\)s vertices and is \\(n-1\\) of \\(G\\)s edges,
where \\(n\\) is the number of vertices in \\(G\\).

It's possible for a graph to have many different spanning trees.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree of a connected undirected graph is a spanning tree
which has the minimal sum of edge weights.

There are two popular minimum spanning tree algorithms:
1. Kruskal's algorithm
1. Prim's algorithm
