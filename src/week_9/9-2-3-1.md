# Dijkstras Algorithm

## Dijkstras Algorithm
Dijksta's algorithm is an algorithm designed to find the shortest path/distance
between a vertex and all other vertices in a weighted graph.

It works by:
1. Finding the shortest distance from the source vertex to a vertex nearest to it.
2. Finding the shortest distance from the source vertex to a vertex second nearest 
to it
3. Repeated steps 1, then 2, until there are no more to traverse

## Algorithm
```
// Input: 
//     A: the matrix representation of G;
// Output: 
//     W: an array containing the shortest path lengths between vertex u and 
//        all the other vertices in graph G(V, E). Assume that vertices are 
//        represented by their corresponding row/column number
ALGORITHM Dijkstra (G, u)
    S ← {u}
    N ←|V|

    for j = 0 to N-1 do
        W[j] = A[u][j]

    for i = 2 to N do
        find the smallest W[v] such that v is not in S;
        S ← S + {v}

        for all vertices x not in S do
            if W[x] > W[v] + A[v][x]
                W[x] = W[v] + A[v][x]

    return W
```

The time efficiency of this version of Dijkstra's algorithm is considered \\(O(n^3)\\). However, if we implemented
it as a priority queue, the time efficiency would be \\(O(n^2)\\).
