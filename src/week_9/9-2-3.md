# Shortest Path Algorithms

## The Shortest Path Problem
The shortest path between two given vertices in a weighted graph can be defined
as the path which has the minimal sum of its edges weights.

There are three categories for shortest path algorithms:
1. A* Algorithm: Finding the shortest path/distance between two vertices
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding the shortest path/distance between a vertex to all other vertices in 
the graph
3. Floyd's Algorithm: Finding the shortest path/distance between every pair of vertices in a graph
