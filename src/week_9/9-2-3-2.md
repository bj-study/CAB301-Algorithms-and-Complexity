# Floyds Algorithm

## Floyds Algorithm
Floyd's algorithm is an algorithm designed to find the shortest path/distance
from each vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

It works by gradually building up all possible paths/distances from vertex \\(i\\) to
vertex \\(j\\) in turn finding the shortest path/distance between the two vertices.

It does this by computing the distance matrix of a weighted graph with \\(n\\) vertices,
\\(D\\), through a series of \\(n \cdot n\\) matrices. \\(d_{ij}^{(k)}\\) in the \\(i^{th}\\) row
and the \\(j^{th}\\) column of matrix \\(D^{(k)}\\) is equal to the length of the shortest
path among all paths from the \\(i^{th}\\) vertex to the \\(j^{th}\\) vertex with each
intermediate vertex, if any, numbered not higher than \\(k\\).

The recurrence formula is:
\\[
    d_{ij}^{(k)} = min\\{d_{ij}^{(k-1)}, d_{ik}^{(k-1)} + d_{ki}^{(k-1)}\\} \text{ for } k \ge 1
\\]

## Algorithm
```
// Input: 
//     - The weight matrix M of a graph with no negative-length cycles
// Output: 
//     - The distance of the shortest paths lengths
ALGORITHM Floyd(M[1..n, 1..n])
    D ← M
    for k ← 1 to n do
        for i ← 1 to n do
            for j ← 1 to n do
                D[i, j] ← min{D[i, j], D[i, k] + D[k, j]}

    return D
```

The time efficiency of Floyd's algorithm is considered \\(O(n^3)\\).
