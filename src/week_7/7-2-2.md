# Trees

A tree \\(T\\), is a non-linear data structure made up of one or more nodes such that
\\(T\\) is partitioned into disjointed subsets. Each tree has a single node called
the root \\(r\\) where each set branching off the root is a subtree. Trees are 
often used when representing a hierarchy of things, for example, filesystems, 
comments/replies, and family trees.

Here are some other important terms:
- Parent of node \\(n\\): The node directly above \\(n\\)
- Child(ren) of node \\(n\\): The node(s) directly below \\(n\\)
- Root: The only node without a parent
- Leaf: A node without any children
- Siblings: Nodes that share a common parent node
- Subtree: Any node in a tree together with all its decendants
- Height: The number of nodes on the longest path from the root to the leaf
