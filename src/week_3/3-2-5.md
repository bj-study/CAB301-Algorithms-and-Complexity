# Arrays vs Linked Lists

## Similarities
- Both, arrays and linked lists, can be used to implement a more abstract data-structure
called a list

## Differences
- To access the \\(n^{\text{th}}\\) element:
    - in an array, we must index the array by \\(n\\)
    - in a linked list, we must step through the first \\(n-1\\) nodes
- To insert an item to the beginning of:
    - an array, we must first move all the elements in the array before we can
    insert the item. This is not efficient for larger arrays - \\(O(n)\\).
    - a linked list, we can directly insert the item in the beginning and point
    to the previous first item. This is very efficient - \\(O(1)\\).
- To delete an item from:
    - an array, once the item has been removed, we must move all the items - \\(O(n)\\)
    - a linked list, once the item has been removed, we must traverse the pointer 
    chain to find both the successor and predessor and update their pointers - \\(O(n)\\)
- To search an item:
    - in an array, we search the array sequentially or use some binary search if
    the elements are sorted - \\(O(n)\\) for linear search and \\(O(\log n)\\) for binary search.
    - in a linked list, we need to traverse the pointer chain to find the node
    where the item is sored - \\(O(n)\\).
