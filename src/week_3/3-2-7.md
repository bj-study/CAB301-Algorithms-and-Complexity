# Queues

A queue is a linear data structure following FIFO (First In First Out).

- To add an item we use the enqueue operation adding it onto the tail of the stack
- To remove an item we use the dequeue operation removing it from the head of the stack

This means that we don't have access to the items contained within the middle of
the stack.

## Queue Applications
We can use queues in a variety of ways such as:
- Algorithm design
- CPU scheduling
- Disk scheduling
- Managing shared resources between various processes
- Data transferring between IO buffers
