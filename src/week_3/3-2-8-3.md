# Binary Search

If we know that the collection of items will be sorted, we can use a decrease-and-conquer
algorithm.

A decrease-and-conquer algorithm decreases the problem instance into a smaller
instance of the same problem, conquering the larger problem by solving the smaller
instance.

A binary search algorithm is an algorithm that does such a thing.
1. Choose the midpoint of the array
2. If the item of interest is there, then the search is done
3. If the search key is smaller than the selected value at the midpoint, repeat
the search on the lower half of the array
4. If the search key is larger than the selected value at the midpoint, repeat
the search on the upper half of the array

## Pseudocode
```
ALGORITHM BinarySearch(A[0..n-1], K)
// Implements a non-recursive binary search
// Input:
//     - An array A[0..n-1] sorted in ascending order
//     - A search key K
// Output:
//     - The index of the first element of A that matches K or -1 if no match
i <- 0; r <- n - 1

while l <= r do
    m <- floor((l + r) / 2)
    if K = A[m] return m
    else if K < A[m] r <- m - 1
    else l <- m + 1

return -1
```
