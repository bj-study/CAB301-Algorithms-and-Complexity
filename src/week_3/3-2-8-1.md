# Sequential Search

Sequential search algorithms can almost be thought of as the brute force method
of finding some item. We systematically examine each item in turn until the desired
one is found or we run out of items to check.

This is the only algorithm possible when the collection is unsorted. The worst
case scenario is all items must be inspected.

## Pseudocode
```
ALGORITHM SequentialSearch(A[0..n-1], K)
// Searches for a given value in a given array by sequential search
// Input:
//     - An array A[0..n-1]
//     - A search key K
// Output:
//     - The index of the first element of A that matches K or -1 if no match
i <- 0
while i < n and A[i] != K do
    i <- i + 1

    if i < n return i
    else return -1

```

## Efficiency
In the case of sequential search, we choose the comparison \\(A[i] \neq K\\) as
the basic operation. We also assume that this comparison is not performed if the
first conjunct \\(i < n\\) is false.

The worst case in this scenario is when key \\(K\\) does not appear in the array
\\(A\\) at all, or is the last item within the array. This scenario forces the algorithm
to inspect every element within the array.
