# Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure following LIFO (Last In First Out) that stores 
items sequentially only allowing access to the element on the top.

- To add an item we push it onto the top of the stack
- To remove an item we pop it off the top of the stack

This means that we don't have access to the items contained within the middle of
the stack.

## Stack Applications
We can use stacks in a variety of ways such as:
- Checking parenthesis matching in an expression
- Expressing evaluation
- Conversion from one form of expression to another
- Memory management
- Backtracking algorithms
