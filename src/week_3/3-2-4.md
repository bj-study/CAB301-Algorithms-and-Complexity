# Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequence of zero or more elements called nodes. Each node
consists of:
- An item
- A pointer to the next item in the list or `null` if there is no next item

Linked links are dynamic data structures, the length of itself is the number of
nodes the linked list contains.

There are two main types of linked lists:
- **Single Linked List**: Each node, excluding the last, contains a single pointer
to the next node
- **Double Linked List**: Each node, excluding the first and last, contains a 
pointer to its successor and its predecessor.
