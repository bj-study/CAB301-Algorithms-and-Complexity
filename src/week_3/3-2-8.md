# Search Algorithms

Searching algorithms are 'comparison based' algorithms where searching is done
either to confirm a certain item exists in a collection or to find an item labelled
with a given key. This is usually done by comparing an item in the collection 
with the search key.

There are two classical search algorithms:
- Sequential search algorithm
- Binary search algorithm
